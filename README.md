# CHTC-Student-Handbook
A small handbook to help complete tasks for CHTC (Student) Employees. Also contains a list of server locations.

The handbook comes in several versions, but the PDF is the recommended way to read the content. The actual handbook is created in a LaTeX file, allowing it to easily be converted to multiple formats including PDF, Markdown, and more.

* The PDF updates are to be pushed to github on a monthly basis, so they won't
necessarily be updated to the bleeding edge, but they are the most readable. Each PDF release is versioned and dated with the release month.

* Changes to the LaTeX file are pushed to github as soon as they are made, and are versioned and dated as such. The version will be the same as the previous PDF release until ready for a new PDF release version. The date is updated on the day of editing.

There is also a node_locations.txt files - This just contains the locations
of execute nodes (and a few others) that the CHTC manages. Useful for finding
a server that breaks.

---
### Finished
* Update the node locations files and chart in the handbook
* Node rebuild how-to.
* Concert the existing doc to LaTeX format.
* All CHTC nodes, including ACI nodes, are located and documented.

### TODO
* Release 1.0 of the CHTC Student Handbook
